# Simple 2364 Kernal Adapter

![](https://github.com/DL2DW/2564_Kernal_Adapter/blob/main/Images/2364_Kernal_Adapter.jpg)



## Introduction

This is a simple adapter to convert from a 28pin EPROM to a 24pin 2564 PROM. Depending on the EPROM size, the different Kernal can be switched. 

The following sizes can be used as EPROM:

- 2764 = 1x 8k Image/Kernal
- 27128 = 2x 8k Image/Kernal
- 27256 = 4x 8k Image/Kernal
- 27512 = 8x 8k Image/Kernal



## BOM

The required components are only:

- 1x 28pin DIP IC socket
- 3x resistors 10k 0207 THT
- 2x 12pin precision header



## PCB

The PCB can either be ordered directly from [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Simple_2564_Kernal_Adapter.html), or you can create it yourself from the Gerber files available here.
